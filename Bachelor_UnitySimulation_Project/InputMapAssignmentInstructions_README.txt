Hello and welcome to the simulation implementation of the Bachelor Thesis "Soil-based Vegetation Simulation 
For Digital Media" by Jordan Hagemeier.
 
In order to outfit the simulation with its needed input maps, please take a look at this link: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11sr9nfjQVvpegBBfun7hejhaWBa-gqrP?usp=sharing 

This folder contains all input maps used in the simulation. 
An image can be seen, which shows the correct assignment of the downloadable maps in the GroundInfoManager.
Maps that need assignment are: 
- Flow Map
- Occlusion Map
- Clay Map
- Sand Map
- Silt Map
- Soil Acidity Map
- Land Mass  
If for some reason the terrain is not correctly assigned its terrain height data, 
please go to the "Terrain" Object in the scene, and assign the .raw map in the folder "Terrain_HeightMap" to it.
